# TransientSearch

Transient Search is a Windows 10 application whose purpose is to automate the query, results translation and reconfiguration for the input of four specialized astronomical catalogs as SDB’s (Sky Database) in the TheSkyX™ platform.  The four servers are:

1.	IAU Transient Name Server (TNS) is the official IAU mechanism for reporting new astronomical transients such as supernova candidates.
2.	AAVSO International Variable Star Index (VSX) for current listings of galactic nova, BL Lac, AGN, Quasar, and currently reported, but unconfirmed, variable star candidates.
3.	NASA ExoPlanet Archive for the current listing of active ExoPlanet candidates.
4.	IAU Minor Planet Center Ephemeris for the current listing of positions for all Near Earth Objects (NEO).

Transient Search can perform queries of each of these servers then compile the results in a form the TheSkyX can import as either in the clipboard or text file to make a My Chart Elements listing or import into a user Sky Database using Create Sky Database functionality.  The all resultant custom catalogs will contain at least the object name, type, location (ra,dec) and magnitude.  Other data fields may also be translated depending upon the server and the Transient Search version.
